ReadMe Placeholder. Sorry :(<br>
The `Installer.iss` is not complete yet as I don't know how to use inno setup.<br>
We need to run the installer as admin, so we can set Cmder to run as admin.<br>
And the `[Run]` part at the end needs to navigate to where you installed Cmder and run `.\cmder.exe /REGISTER ALL` as admin.<br>
But idk how to do any of that properly. So you will have to fix it in post.<br>
Once I or someone else figures out how to build the `Installer.iss` properly then we can finish off this project and readme.<br>
